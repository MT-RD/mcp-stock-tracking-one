### 🚀 Deployment Options Analysis:

**Option 1: Deploy Current Minimal Version (Recommended for Testing)**

You can deploy the current minimal app right now to test the deployment process:

✅ Pros:

- Tests the entire deployment pipeline
- Validates Hugging Face Spaces integration
- Confirms all dependencies work in production
- Quick feedback on any deployment issues
- Can iterate and redeploy easily

✅ What works:

- Basic UI will load and display
- Interface is functional (even without backend)
- Perfect for testing deployment workflow

**Option 2: Add MCP Server Connection First**

Adding MCP server connection before deployment:

❌ Challenges:

- Need a running Modal MCP server (additional setup)
- More complex to debug if deployment fails
- Harder to isolate deployment vs. functionality issues

✅ Benefits:

- More complete functionality when deployed
- Better user experience for testing
